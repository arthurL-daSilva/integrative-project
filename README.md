# integrative-project
This project has the intent to solve a issue of a random company.
they were having delay when gathering information on ships schedule
due to every one of them be in every diferent site or app.

Keeping there in mind, me and my classmate decided to create
this simple and site in order to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, we were unskilled and had a couple of days ultil
the deadline, so we did what we could. Hope it is not that bad.

Here was our steps on the site creation:

First of all, we created a desing using Figma, then we exported it to HTML
using an extension iinside the own app. It was great, but all the conversion 
to HTML brought all the pictures and elements together on <div class="1_1" or 
"1_11". Moreover, the CSS code whas within the HTML indexand all the "position" 
element was as "absolute".

We spend a lot of time studying the code so we could work on it to make it useful.
We had quite a few classes focused on programming so that wasn't easy.

All the HTML index that we export were kind of "corrupted" somehow: pictures
senteces, words, numbers, squares, all them were out of position, what took
from us more time that we didn't have.

In the end, after all the problems were "solved", everything were where it belongs,
I devide to use an API for weather forecast. I couldn't finish it because I
didn't know how to use and had no time to learn it.

This was my history crating this project, hope it helps someone who it's reading this.
Have a nice day!
